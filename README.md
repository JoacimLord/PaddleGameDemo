# # LFW (The Luna Framework) - Demo Paddle Game

# Disclaimer

This demo was written with an old version of the API and has been changed alot since then.
The functionality reached from main.cpp is working the same way.


# How To Get Started

Download the project and run the Setup.bat. Start the generated .sln and run!
Use the settings to control the amount of "pillars" and when to sort them (including a reset button).


# About

This is a demo game made in 30 minutes using 'LFW' as an example on how to work with the API.
The game logic isn't perfect and there is some glitching going on with the collision between the paddle and the ball, but it gets the idea across.
