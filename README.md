# Demo Paddle Game made with The Luna Framework


# Disclaimer

This demo was written with an old version of the API and it might have changed since then.


# About

This is a demo game made in 30 minutes using The Luna Framework as an example on how to work with the API.

The game logic isn't perfect and there is some glitching going on with the collision between the paddle and the ball, but it gets the idea across.


Thanks for checking it out and good luck with your own games and apps!
